# BookListApp
VanillaJS App to compare ES5 vs. ES6

Two projects, with idential functions. To create a basic booklist database.
There is an ES5 version and an ES6 version. To highlight the difference between using raw prototypes (ES5) and the the syntactic sugar of using classes (ES6 - prototypes 'under the hood').
